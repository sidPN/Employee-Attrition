# Prediction-of-Employee-Attrition-in-Companies

Today, in the age of “Big Data”, companies around the world are collecting as much data as possible about their customers and performing all kinds of analysis on them using concepts of Machine Learning. 
These companies, for a long time, have also had large internal datasets which contain records of their employees. 
These datasets contain a wide variety of detailed information about their employees, including their pay scale, their employment level, working hours as well as details from their internal survey. 
This data is extremely valuable, to judge employees general sense of happiness, satisfaction with the company and the work they do.

Attrition has always been expensive for companies. If there was a robust way to predict employee dissatisfaction, companies could predict employees who would or are planning to leave. 
This would be very valuable for companies, as it could inform companies hiring policies, and help them plan for the future as to deciding, how many employees to hire, the vacancies that need to be filled in, project continuity and knowledge transfer tasks and how much should their financial outlay be for new hires depending on the number of people to replace. 
Hence, this prediction of employees who are possibly looking to leave the company, could be extremely valuable.
The work outlined in this paper looks at this problem. I am trying to address this research question by trying to determine the factors, which could be relevant to determining what causes an employee to be disgruntled with their work environment and eventually leave.
